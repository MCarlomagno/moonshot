# moonshot
Arcade JavaScript game for "Game Off" jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme, in this case: "Moonshot".

## About the project
This project is a prototype spacecraft that works with propulsion under the effects of gravity.

## Setup
Install dependencies and prepare the build directory:

```sh
npm install
```

To watch files for changes, and launch a dev server:
 
```sh
npm run serve
```
or you can just directly open the index.html file from your browser.

## Technologies

### Javascript (ES6)
On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.

### Webpack
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

### Babel
Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.

### Phaser library
Phaser is a free and fast open source framework for canvas and WebGL powered browser games.
